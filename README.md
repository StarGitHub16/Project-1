# Project-1

Melad Sameri

This is a website advertising a game plaza, where individuals can come 
and play a variety of different games!

The user will be able to
    1) Find information regarding current events happening at the plaza.
    2) Learn about the cost and hours that the plaza are open.
    3) The ability to make reservations ahead of time for larger events.

The website is developed using HTML5 and CSS3

The website can be navigated using the nav bar on the right, to go to each page,
Between Main, Details, and Sign Up resepectively.

Some Future Improvements that could be made:
    1) Make adjustments for the site to be optimized for moblie devices.
    2) Have a way to pay through the website, currently main way is in person.
    3) If possible perhaps make a dedicated page listing all the actual games   available in the plaza.
